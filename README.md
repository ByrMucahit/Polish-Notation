# Polish-Notation
Polish Notation is term of Automata .

<h3>Introduce</h3>
<p>Term of Polish Notation is clever parenthesis-free notational scheme. It was invented by Polish
logician Jan Lukasiewicz (1878-1956) </p>

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>Polish Notation has that in which the operation symbols (+, *, ....) come after the operands. This can
be derived by tracing around the tree from the other side, keeping our right
hand on the tree and then reversing the resultant string. Both of these methods
of notation are useful for computer science. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>
Let us consider the language generated by the following CFG:

                                              <h2>PROD 1 S ----> AB</h2>
                                              PROD 2 A ----> a
                                              PROD 3 B ----> b
                                              
<p>There are two different sequences of applications of the productions generate the word ab. One is PROD 1, PROD 2 and PROD 3. The other is PROD 1 , PROD 3, PROD 2. </p>

  <span><h2>S</h2></span> --> <span><h2>AB</h2></span> --> <span><h2>aB</h2></span> --> <span><h2>ab</h2></span>  OR <span><h2>S</h2></span> --> <span><h2>AB</h2></span> --> <span><h2>Ab</h2></span> --> <span><h2>ab</h2></span> 
  
  <p>However, when we draw the corresponding syntax trees we see that two derivations are essentially the same :</p>
